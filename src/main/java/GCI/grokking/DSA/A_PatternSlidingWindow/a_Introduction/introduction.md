# 1.0 Introduction

## Introduction

In many problems dealing with an array \(or a LinkedList\), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays \(or sublists\) of a given size. For example, take a look at this problem:

> Given an array, find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘K’ in it.

Let’s understand this problem with a real input: `Array: [1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2], K=5` Here, we are asked to find the average of all contiguous subarrays of size ‘5’ in the given array. Let’s solve this:

`For the first 5 numbers (subarray from index 0-4), the average is: (1+3+2+6-1)/5 => 2.2(1+3+2+6−1)/5=>2.2` `The average of next 5 numbers (subarray from index 1-5) is: (3+2+6-1+4)/5 => 2.8(3+2+6−1+4)/5=>2.8` `For the next 5 numbers (subarray from index 2-6), the average is: (2+6-1+4+1)/5 => 2.4(2+6−1+4+1)/5=>2.4`

The efficient way to solve this problem would be to visualize each contiguous subarray as a sliding window of ‘5’ elements. This means that we will slide the window by one element when we move on to the next subarray. To reuse the sum from the previous subarray, we will subtract the element going out of the window and add the element now being included in the sliding window. This will save us from going through the whole subarray to find the sum and, as a result, the algorithm complexity will reduce to O\(N\).

Here is the algorithm for the Sliding Window approach:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

cla ss AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK {
  public static double[] findAverages(int K, int[] arr) {
    double[] result = new double[arr.length - K + 1];
    double windowSum = 0;
    int windowStart = 0;
    for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < arr.length; windowEnd++) {
      windowSum += arr[windowEnd]; // add the next element
      // slide the window, we don't need to slide if we've not hit the required window size of 'k'
      if (windowEnd >= K - 1) {
        result[windowStart] = windowSum / K; // calculate the average
        windowSum -= arr[windowStart]; // subtract the element going out
        windowStart++; // slide the window ahead
      }
    }

    return result;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double[] result = AverageOfSubarrayOfSizeK.findAverages(5, new int[] { 1, 3, 2, 6, -1, 4, 1, 8, 2 });
    System.out.println("Averages of subarrays of size K: " + Arrays.toString(result));
  }
}
